Hi there! 👋  
I'm **Zeynep**, a software engineer working in defense & aerospace.

I specialize in **secure networked systems, real-time software, and Common Criteria (EAL4+) aligned architectures**, building mission-critical applications that operate under strict security, performance, and reliability constraints.

I currently work on **defense-grade secure gateways and inspection systems**, where I design and implement:
- protocol-aware traffic processing  
- malware scanning and decision engines  
- real-time monitoring and control services  
- security-focused system architectures and documentation  

My background spans from **low-level C/C++ and system components** to **distributed backends and modern web interfaces**, with a strong focus on long-lifecycle and regulated environments.

Outside of work, I actively follow developments in **quantum computing, machine learning, and quantum–classical hybrid approaches**, particularly where these fields intersect with **optimization, security, and large-scale systems**. I enjoy exploring how emerging computational paradigms can inform future high-performance and security-critical software architectures.

Let’s connect!
